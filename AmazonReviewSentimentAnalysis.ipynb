In the first one a hunter would inspect a brick, hitting a wall, or finding his dead buddy, but in Manhunt 2, they usually don't care, spoiling any opportunity to lure a hunter away from his friends to disfigure and break him.

Gone is the simple and enjoyable kill from point A to point B plot, now, it's all twisted with \"gotta find this guy, gotta find this chick, gotta figure this out....who am I, what happened\"  This doesn't directly affect the action, but somehow it makes for a very rushed and detached experience, hardly any of it worth remembering.  Essentially they made a mountain out of a mole-hill, and it really just annoys more than anything.  I had a hard time of following why I was at a place and found it much simpler in the original to just know I was on my way through to fight another type of gang for the director's joy, but now it's all finding out about a character I care nothing for in a story I care nothing for.

About 60% of the kill is plainly visible, but 40% is blurred.  These kills are actually pretty good, and I especially like the firearm executions, but coupled with the filters and obstructions they had to program in, it really doesn't matter.
